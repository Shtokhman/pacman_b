# Pac-Man maze arcade game
This is the university project. The idea is to create classic web version of original 1980s game, created by Toru Iwatani, using 'bold' HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
## Gameplay
The gameplay is pretty intuitive - the player navigates Pac-Man through a maze with no dead ends. The maze is filled with dots, and includes four multi-colored ghosts: Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde. There is a passageway from the left side of the screen to the right side, bonus fruits. The objective of the game is to eat all dots before ghosts take all available lives. There are regular small dots and big dots, which make ghosts blinking and egible. The player also earns points over the game: 10pts for small dot, 50pts for big dot, 200pts for a blue ghost. A stage is completed when all dots are eaten.
## Realization stages
* Stage 0: Get to know about rules, gameplay, interface, etc., play Pac-Man
* Stage 1: Analyze standard algorithms, develop own one basing on needs and requirements.
* Stage 2: Create game field, mark dots and walls
* Stage 3: Implement created previously algorithm to develop Pac-Man and ghosts behaviour, including game-required actions(count points, eat.be eaten, etc.), testing.
* Stage 4: Improve interface by adding animations(blinking, eating, audio...), testing.
* Stage 5: Final testing and code review.
## Goal before pass stage 2
Go from realization stage 0 to stage 3
